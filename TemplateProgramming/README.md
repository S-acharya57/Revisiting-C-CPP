## Templates in C++

- powerful tool
- foundation of generic programming
- code that is independent of any particular type
- blueprint or formula for generic class or function

1. Function Template
2. Class Template

## 1. Function Template

    - operate with generic types
    - adapted to more than one type or class without replacing code for each type
    - pass data type as parameter, so no need to write different function for different data types

## 2. Class Template

    - for classes with different data type but pretty much same functionality
